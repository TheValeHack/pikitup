# PIKITUP

## Description
Pikitup is a web application solution for everyone to start recycling reusable scraps from their home. Users can order a "driver" to pick and collect their waste at the doorstep. The reusable waste will be exchanged with in-app coins which can be exchanged to cash or to buy interesting items available in the application.

## Background
Pikitup is my team project for KomodoHacks Hackathon. I was the main developer in this project. The design, frontend, and backend were mostly written and made by me. I used Figma for the design, Bootstrap and jQuery for the frontend, and Flask for the backend. This project was sent to KomodoHacks 1.0 on July 24th, 2022. This project got awarded 3rd Place Winner for Sustainable Development Track.
